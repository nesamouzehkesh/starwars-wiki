# About

## App structure

- `elements` directory is meant for reusable UI elements that can be used across the
  project.

- `pages` directory is meant to contain the main pages of the project but since this project is a small one I only have one page, `actorsList` inside this directory. Later could be many more.

## How to run

- `yarn`
- `yarn start`

## Note

- I used `create-react-app` as the boilerplater.
- Did not have time to write tests but I can add and push to repo later if that is a requirement.
